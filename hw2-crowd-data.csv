This vehicle comes with the following Packages:
Convenience Package ($600 value)
Smart Key System with Push Button Start
Auto-Dimming Rearview Mirror with HomeLink


This vehicle comes with the following Features:
Convenience
This ""intelligent"" cruise control system uses laser or radar to maintain a preset following distance behind another vehicle, automatically braking or accelerating as required.
Safety and Security
The vehicle is equipped with a system that senses, and then prepares, the vehicle and/or occupants, for an impending forward collision.
The vehicle constantly monitors the roadway in front of the vehicle and identifies and tracks pedestrians on an interior display. If the system determines a likely impact, it will automatically take preventative steps to avoid hitting the pedestrian.
The vehicle is equipped with a camera that displays an image of the area behind the vehicle on an interior display.
An active lane departure system alerts the driver of unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane and automatically maintains the vehicle's position within that lane.
Brake assist senses panic braking from the speed of the brake pedal's travel and applies all available power brake boost.
Technology and Telematics
Without the need for a manufacturer specific app to be installed on the smart device, the vehicle infotainment system can access and control functions of a smart device physically plugged-into the vehicle.
Mobile devices can wirelessly connect to the internet through the vehicle's private mobile network.",https://www.southhillskia.net/inventory/used-2019-toyota-camry-le-front-wheel-drive-sedan-4t1b11hk4ku798981/?store_code=PA051&sd_campaign=adwords&sd_digadprov=adpearance&sd_channel=shopping&sd_campaign_type=adwords&sd_digadcid=20534800981&sd_digadkeyword=&sd_location=9005925&sd_position=&sd_digadid=&adpdevice=c&adpprov=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAh8OtBhCQARIsAIkWb69vmJiUpNoUBl1JGQAddLVsYa3yRjNiKqyaFMIjsOcQzorbamZ9AIQaAtIYEALw_wcB,https://drive.google.com/open?id=18IuYcLL3j-Bb_3YwEzK5d3Y8hJ4qyUYb

* If you’re shopping for a compact SUV with good cargo space, a car-like ride and a low sticker price, the 2014 Toyota RAV4 is worth a look. Audio buffs will love the straightforward Entune audio system that includes apps and Bluetooth audio streaming. Those seeking an all-electric SUV will only find it in the 2014 RAV4 EV.

* Roomy interior for people and cargo, strikes a good balance between ride comfort and sure-footed handling. Source: Edmunds
* The 2014 RAV4 captures the spirit of freedom that began with the original RAV4, yet breaks new ground in refinement, practicality and technology. With expressive styling and a roomy, comfortable interior, RAV4 is decidedly refined, but with agile handling and all-weather capability. The traditionally mounted spare now resides under the cargo floor so that the RAV4 now has a true liftgate, opening up instead of out. Opt for the RAV4 Limited and you'll get a power liftgate with jam protection that even offers height adjustment. From its efficient engine to its new 6-speed automatic transmission and updated suspension, RAV4 is every bit a driver's machine. It's now available with the all-new Dynamic Torque-Control All-Wheel Drive system. It improves handling by distributing power from front to rear, and manages the vehicle's braking system from side to side for maximum control on a variety of surfaces. RAV4's standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder DOHC engine produces 176 horsepower along with 172 lb.-ft. of torque to make short work of long roads. Treat your friends and family like first-class passengers. With the pull of a handle, they can recline the rear seatbacks and enjoy the ride. Even with all the leg room offered by RAV4's interior, there's still plenty of room for your gear. In fact, you can stow up to 38.4 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seatbacks in their upright position. You can even fold the second-row seats in seconds by pulling the handle up and lower the seatbacks to create a wide, flat load space with 73.4 cubic feet of cargo capacity. Optional features now include Blind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert which provides audible and visual cues when the RAV4 detects oncoming traffic. The available Smart Key fob allows you to lock and unlock the doors and liftgate with one touch and start the vehicle with the push of a button, Display Audio with Navigation and Entune, 11 JBL Gr",https://www.carfax.com/vehicle/2T3RFREV2EW205661,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OkRNxjS_5KgPe370ldKQMaOkHySr_8WP
